# Python To-Do List

## Overview
This is a simple, yet powerful, To-Do List application built with Python. It provides an intuitive command-line interface for managing your tasks efficiently. 

## Features
The application supports the following operations:

1. **Add a New Task**: You can add a new task to your list. Each task will be stored with a unique identifier for easy reference.

2. **Mark a Task as Completed**: Once you've finished a task, you can mark it as completed. This helps in tracking your progress and maintaining focus on the tasks at hand.

3. **View the Tasks List**: You can view your entire list of tasks at any time. The list will show both completed and pending tasks, providing a comprehensive view of your to-dos.

4. **Delete a Task**: If a task is no longer relevant or if it was created by mistake, you can remove it from the list.
